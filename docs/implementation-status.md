## üê≥ Container Development Approach

### Why Container-First?

The implementation prioritizes container deployment for several strategic reasons:

1. **Development Velocity**: Faster iteration without macOS-specific complexity
2. **Cross-platform Testing**: Validate core AI and business logic
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Enable server-side monitoring scenarios
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Container Capabilities

The current container implementation provides:

- **Full AI Processing**: Ollama with Mistral 7B and LLaVA models
- **API Endpoints**: HTTP interfaces for rule management and analysis
- **Data Persistence**: Volume-mounted storage for rules and events
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and logging
- **Resource Management**: Configurable CPU and memory limits

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Quick start development environment
make docker-run

# Monitor logs and health
make docker-logs
make health-check

# Iterate on code
# Edit Swift files, rebuild container
docker-compose up --build

# Test AI functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rules \
  -d '{"text": "Block violent content"}'
```

git clone <repo>
cd kid_guard_ai
make docker-run

# Access services
# - Ollama API: http://localhost:11434
# - Proxy service: http://localhost:8080
# - Container logs: make docker-logs
```

### For Testing AI Features
```bash
# Test rule parsing
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "mistral:7b-instruct", "prompt": "Parse this rule: Block violent content"}'

# Test screenshot analysis (when implemented)
# Upload screenshot ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí Violation detection
```

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the complete KidGuard AI application, with the container approach enabling rapid development and testing of core AI functionality before moving to full macOS system integration.
