   - ‚úÖ All critical TODOs completed

3. **Fixed Toggle and Delete Functionality**
   - Rules can now be toggled on/off properly
   - Delete button works and persists changes
   - Proper binding for SwiftUI controls

4. **Improved AI JSON Parsing**

## üìä Current Status

**Fully Working:**
- ‚úÖ Menu bar app with 4 tabs
- ‚úÖ Text-based rule creation (AI-powered via Ollama)
- ‚úÖ Rule toggle on/off
- ‚úÖ Delete rules
- ‚úÖ Rules persist to UserDefaults
- ‚úÖ Start/Stop monitoring
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture every 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ Screenshot analysis with AI

- AI sometimes generates verbose JSON (improved but not perfect)

**Not Implemented (Not Critical for MVP):**
- Network proxy monitoring (requires Network Extension)
- Cloud storage (AWS S3 integration)
- LaunchDaemon/system integration
- Daemon IPC communication

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Test the Complete MVP ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy

**What to test:**
1. Create rules with text input ("Block violent content")

3. Wait for screenshots (every 10 seconds)
4. Go to Activity tab
5. Expand events and click "View Screenshot"
6. Toggle rules on/off
7. Delete rules

**Payoff:** Verify your working MVP!

### Option 2: Improve UX
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Difficulty:** Medium

**What to improve:**
1. Keep menu bar window open after actions
2. Add inline rule editing
3. Improve empty states
4. Add loading indicators
5. Better error messages

**Payoff:** More polished user experience

### Option 3: Add Network Monitoring
**Time:** 3-5 days  
**Difficulty:** Hard

**What to do:**
1. Research macOS Network Extension framework
2. Create system proxy or packet filter
3. Intercept web traffic
4. Analyze URLs against rules
